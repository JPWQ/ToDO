This project is a simple TUI to do list application. There are two menus. The first is the Collections menu. Collections organize task lists. 

'a' - Add a task to the highlighted Collection.  
'c' = Create a new Collection.  
'd' - Delete the highlighted Collection.  
'e' - Edit the name of the highlighted Collection.  
'Enter' - View the tasks of the highlighted Collection.  

The second menu is the Tasks menu. Each Collection has it's own array of tasks.  

'd' - Delete the highlighted Task.  
'e' - Edit the name of the highlighted Task.  
'Enter' - Toggle the completed value. Press Enter to mark and unmark the Task as completed.
